## Setting Up Supabase Storage

In the short guide, we see how we can set up a remote data source by using breadroll's `.supabaseStorage` to retrieve files from a specified Supabase Storage bucket. Before we get to it, you need to make sure you have a <Link className="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank">Supabase Account</Link> and have <Link className="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/security/access-control" target="_blank">set up access control</Link> for your bucket.

<div className="mt-10">
Next, we install `breadroll` & `@supabase/supabase-js`

```bash filename="bash" copy
bun add breadroll @supabase/supabase-js
```

</div>

<div className="mt-6">
Next, we collect all sensitive and non-sensitive data we need from Supabase and then create the Supabase client; we'll create an <Link className="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/env" target="_blank">environment variable</Link> for sensitive data like `public_anon_key`.

```.env filename=".env"
SUPABASE_KEY=public_anon_key
```

Now we set up the Supbase client, and then we pass the client to the `Breadroll` instance, for this example we'll be working with CSV files

```ts filename="index.ts" copy
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const key = String(Bun.env.SUPABASE_KEY);
const client = createClient("https://org.supabase.co", key);
```

Next, we import and setup the `Breadroll` instance and then pass the Supabase client to the `Breadroll` instance via the `DataframeReadOptions.supabase`, and then we are set to retrieve our CSV file from our Supabase bucket. **Note**: This uses `.download()` internally and will only work with <Link className="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-download" target="_blank">private</Link> buckets.

```ts filename="index.ts" copy
import Breadroll from "breadroll";
const csv = new Breadroll({ header: true, delimiter: ",", supabase: client });

const cities = await csv.open.supabaseStorage("bucket", "cities.csv");
```

That's it, you're all set to start performing some data magic ðŸ§™.
