### `Dataframe`

While breadroll ðŸ¥Ÿ uses the nomenclature **Dataframe** for the data structure it works with, it is only similar to a dataframe in the API that is provided to the user, in truth it is an array of records (objects, key-value pair) given by `Array<Record<string, unknown>>{:ts}` - the key of `string` is the the header values from the parsed file, and the value of `unknown` basically holds the values, ie.every `Array<Record<string, unknown>>{:ts}` is a **"row"** in the dataframe.
