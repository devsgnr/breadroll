## breadroll

breadroll 🥟 (with a small **'b'**) is an intuitive lightweight library for type-safe data processing, designed with type-safety, developer experience and reduced runtime errors in mind, it is written in TypeScript and optimized for [Bun](https://bun.sh)'s runtime APIs.

- ⚡ **Fast**: breadroll is built on Bun, the all-in-one Javascript runtime built for speed
- 📁 **File I/O**: Support for various data sources - **Local, HTTPS, & Supabase Storage**
- 😊 **Easy-to-use**: Compose queries using filter keywords that are simple and are easy to comprehend

---

### Installation

System Requirements:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.0.22
- MacOS, Linux
- Typescript >= 5.1

---

#### Bun

Breadroll is built on and optimized for Bun.js. You can install Bun by running the following

```bash
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

create a new Bun project by running

```bash
bun init
```

then you can now install **Breadroll** using

```bash
bun add breadroll
```

## Overview

### Easy API

breadroll provides an easy to use API that gets you from zero to data processing in no time, with lazy loading of these delimited files via Bun's File I/O `Bun.file()`, the file parsed based on the `DataframeReadOptions`, and convert into a `Dataframe`, and easily read out the content of the Dataframe using `.value`.

```typescript
import Breadroll, { Dataframe } from "breadroll";

const csv: Breadroll = new Breadroll({ header: true, delimiter: "," });
```

Example: From one instance example above, you can open multiple `csv` files

```typescript
const df: Dataframe = await csv.open.local("./data/ds_salaries.csv");
```

### Remote Data Sources

breadroll makes it easy to work with remote data sources with current support for HTTPS and Supabase Storage. With other remote data sources on the roadmap.

```typescript
const df: Dataframe = await csv.open.https("https://.../.../filename.csv");
const df: Dataframe = await csv.open.supabaseStorage("bucketName", "filepath");
```

### Filtering

Peform complex filtering; with various filters including range filters like `is between` that can be achieved using an optional function parameter `limit` which is the upper limit. These range filter are only effective with numbers (integers, floating-point).

```typescript
df.filter("age", "is between", 30, 40);
```

Perform even more complex filtering with multiple / chained filter, you can chain the filter ie. filtering the previously filtered `Dataframe`, the chained filter can be as long as you need them to be.

```typescript
df.filter("age", "is between", 30, 40).filter("salary", ">", 70000).filter("work_year", "==", 2020);
```

### Data Transformation

Perform whatever transformation you'd like to perform on the value of a specified column, from simple transformation like `value + 2`, to complex mathematical transformations that can be paired with the in-built [numeric constant object](/docs/NumericConstants/math)

```typescript
df.apply({ key: "salary", fn: (v) => v / (40 * 4), newkey: "per_hour" });
```

### A Little Math

Get a single number that accurately represents the underlying data with the many provided aggregation functions, the likes of average (mean), max, min, sum, count, etc. with more in development

```typescript
df.sum("capital_gain");
df.average("capital_gain");
df.count;
```
