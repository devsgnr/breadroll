## Running & Building

After going through the steps in [setting up](/contribution/development/setup) the project, there are some important things that you need to be aware of;

---

### Important commands

- `bun test:local{:bash}` - Runs the complete local test(s)
- `bun test:ci{:bash}` - Runs the complete test suite(s) in GitHub Workflow runners
- `bun run demo.ts{:bash}` - Runs the `demo.ts` file for manual testing
- `bun prepare{:bash}` - Install husky
- `bun build:unix{:bash}` - Builds source and tests build on Github Workflows `ubuntu & macos-latest` runner
- `bun build:windows{:bash}` - Builds source and tests build on Github Workflows `windows-latest` runner
- `bun build:stable{:bash}` - Builds sources, tests build using `bun test:ci{:bash}` and publishes distribution

---

### Building

breadroll is built and optimized for the Bun runtime, and hence we use the `Bun.build(){:typescript}` JavaScript API together with `tsc` to build and bundle breadroll. This means that all source targets Bun and are prefixed with the `// @bun` pragma which removes the need for re-transpilation, reduces startup time and improves performance. You can read more [here](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler#target).
