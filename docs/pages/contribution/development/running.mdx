## Running & Building

After going through the steps in [setting up](/contribution/development/setup) the project, there are some important things that you need to be aware of;

---

### Important commands

- `bun test:local{:bash}` - Runs the complete local test suite
- `bun test:ci{:bash}` - Only meant to run the complete test suite in GitHub Workflow
- `bun run demo.ts{:bash}` - Runs the `demo.ts` file for manual testing
- `bun prepare{:bash}` - Install husky
- `bun build:pre-release{:bash}` - Run the local test suite and then builds the source
- `bun build:stable-release{:bash}` - Run the `bun test:ci{:bash}` suite and then builds the source

---

### Building

breadroll is built and optimized for the Bun runtime, and hence we use the `Bun.build(){:typescript}` JavaScript API to build and bundle breadroll. This means that all source targets Bun and are prefixed with the `// @bun` pragma which removes the need for re-transpilation, reduces startup time and improves performance. You can read more [here](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler#target).
