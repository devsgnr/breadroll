## Running & Building

After going through the steps in [setting up](/contribution/development/setup) the project, there are some important things that you need to be aware of;

---

### Important commands

- `bun test{:bash}` - runs the complete test suite
- `bun run demo.ts{:bash}` - runs the `demo.ts` file for manual testing
- `bun prepare{:bash}` - install husky
- `bun build:pre-release{:bash}` - run the test suite and then build the entire `src` into a `dist` folder

---

### Building

breadroll is built and optimized for the Bun runtime, and hence we use the `Bun.build(){:typescript}` JavaScript API to build and bundle breadroll. This means that all source targets Bun and are prefixed with the `// @bun` pragma which removes the need for re-transpilation, reduces startup time and improves performance. You can read more [here](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler#target).
