## Documentation

breadroll is documented using [Nextra](https://nextra.site). You can find the documentation source code at `/docs` in the project root directory. The documentation runs on Next.js, MDX & Tailwind.

To start contributing to the documentation, First navigate to `/docs` and start the development server by running:

```bash
bun dev
```

Edit the markdown (.mdx) files and automatically see changes in the browser. Other commands are for building and previewing the site;

```bash
bun run build
bun run start
```

### Pre-commit Build

It is **not** neccessary for you to run these commands manually; only the `bun run build{:bash}` command is ran during the pre-commit stage, to make sure the documentation build without any errors. Again we utitlize [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for this step.
