## Setup the project

### Requirements

Only one tool is required:

- Install [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.0.22

  Unix (Mac & Linux)

  ```bash copy
  curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
  ```

  Windows

  ```powershell copy
  > powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```

Other tools that are used are:

- Prettier
- ESlint

for code styling and linting, installation of extension for these are different amongst code editors; but if you use Visual Studio Code (VS Code), then we recommend installing the following extensions (but you're free to work with tools that works for you):

- [ESLint by Microsft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier - Code Formatter by Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

### Installing dependencies

After installing Bun and other tooling, installing core-dependencies and dev-dependencies is as simple as running:

```bash
bun install
```

Next, setup the Github Hooks, for our pre-commit script by running:

```bash
bun prepare
```

After all dev-dependencies and core dependencies have been installed, you're good to go. **Start writing the future of breadroll**

### Manual Testing

If you want to perform any manual testing by standing as the end user; then create a file `demo.ts` in the project `root`, the file is already added to the `.gitignore` file and will not be committed. After creating this file and adding your code snippet. You can then run this command in the project `root`;

```bash
bun run demo.ts
```
