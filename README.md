breadroll ü•ü is a simple lightweight application toolkit for parsing csv, tsv, and other delimited files, performing EDA (exploratory data analysis), and data processing operations on multivariate datasets. Think pandas but written in Typescript and developed on the [Bun](https://bun.sh) Runtime.

‚ö†Ô∏è This library is experimental and is still in active development. Although we make sure each version is tested throughly,
we suggest you use it with some caution, as some unexpected behaviors can be present.

<br/>

- **Fast**: breadroll is built on Bun, the all-in-one Javascript runtime built for speed
- **File I/O**: With current support for local data sources, **remote sources support** currently include - `https`
- **Easy-to-use**: Compose queries using filter keywords that reads like English and are easy to comprehend

---

### **Installation**

System Requirements:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- MacOS (tested), Linux (untested)
- Typescript >= 5.1

---

#### Bun
breadroll is built on and optimized for Bun.js. You can install Bun by running the following
```bash
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
create a new Bun project by running
```bash
bun init
```
then you can now install **breadroll** using
```bash
bun add breadroll
```
---

### **Easy API**
breadroll provides an easy to use API that gets you from zero to data processing in no time, with lazy loading of these delimited files via Bun's File I/O `Bun.file()`, the file parsed based on the `DataframeReadOptions`, and convert into a `Dataframe`, and easily read out the content of the Dataframe using `.value`.

```typescript
const csv: Breadroll = new Breadroll({ header: true, delimiter: "," });
```

Example: From one instance example above, you can open multiple `csv` files

```typescript
const df: Dataframe = await csv.open.local("./data/ds_salaries.csv");
const selected: Dataframe = df.select(["job_title", "salary", "salary_currency", "salary_in_usd"]);
const values: Array<ObjectType> = selected.values

console.log(values)
```

### **Remote Data Sources**
breadroll makes it easy to work with remote data sources with current support for fetching over `https`. With other remote data sources on the roadmap.

```typescript
const df: Dataframe = await csv.open.https("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devsgnr/breadroll/.../ds_salaries.csv");
const selected: Dataframe = df.select(["job_title", "salary", "salary_currency", "salary_in_usd"]);
```

### **Filtering**
Peform complex filtering; with various filters including range filters like `in between` that can be achieved using an optional function parameter `limit` which is the upper limit. These range filter are only effective with numbers (integers, floating-point).
```typescript
df.filter("age", "is between", 30, 40); // returns number
```
Perform even more complex filtering with multiple / chained filter, you can chain the filter ie. filtering the previously filtered `Dataframe`, the chained filter can be as long as you need them to be.
```typescript
df.filter("age", "is between", 30, 40)
  .filter("salary", "greater than", 70000)
  .filter("work_year", "equals", 2020); // return Dataframe
```

### **A Little Math**
Get a single number that accurately represents the underlying data with the many provided aggregation functions, the likes of average (mean), max, min, sum, count, etc. with more in development
```typescript
df.sum("capital_gain") // returns number
df.average("capital_gain") // returns number
df.count // returns number
```
